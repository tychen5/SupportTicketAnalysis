# Issue Grouping Analysis

This Python script, `issue_grouping_analysis.py`, is designed to analyze and group issues based on their similarity in content. The script processes data from three input dataframes and identifies identical content in specified columns. It then groups the issues based on their similarity and saves the results in a pickle file.

### Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- pickle
- functools
- operator

### Usage

1. Replace the dummy dataframes (`name_and_df_take`, `namedesc_and_df_take`, `desc_and_df_take`, and `issue_df`) with your actual dataframes.
2. Add your additional processing steps in the specified section.
3. Replace the paths with your own paths and make sure to update any variable names or values that may contain sensitive information.
4. Run the script to analyze and group issues based on their similarity.

### Functions

- `identity_group(takedf1, takedf2, takedf3, take_col_name='take')`: Identifies identical content in the given dataframes and groups them based on their similarity.
- `find_identical(col_name)`: Finds identical content in the given column and returns a list of lists containing indices of identical content.
- `find_in(li, key)`: Returns 1 if the key is in the list, otherwise returns 0.
- `find_same(issue_li, col_name)`: Finds the same content in the specified column and returns the length of the resulting dataframe.
- `find_duplicate(issuestr, key)`: Returns 1 if the key is in the issue string, otherwise returns 0.

### Output

The script saves the final results in a pickle file named `grouping_results_tuple2.pkl` and `grouing_results_df2.pkl`. The first file contains a tuple with two elements: a list of lists containing indices of identical content and the issue dataframe. The second file contains the cleaned issue dataframe with grouped issues.
